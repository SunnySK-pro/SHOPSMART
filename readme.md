The **ShopSmart backend** is built using **Express.js** and **MongoDB**, providing a robust RESTful API to serve grocery product data to the frontend. It includes routes for fetching all products, handles CORS and JSON parsing, and connects securely to a MongoDB database using Mongoose. Product data is seeded through a script, ensuring 25–30 grocery items are available with names, prices, descriptions, categories, units, and valid image URLs. The backend is designed to be scalable and easily extendable to support additional features like authentication, cart persistence, and order management.
